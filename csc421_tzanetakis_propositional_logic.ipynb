    "# INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW \n",
    "Knowledge-based agents use a process of **reasoning** over an internal **representation** of knowledge to decide what actions to take. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that by using a factored representation (like we did in CSP problems) some parts of the agent can work in a domain-independent fashion. That way information can be combined in different ways, the agents can adapt to new environments and explicitly describe goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by exploring **propositional logic** which is a less expressive subset of **first-order logic**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**KNOWLEDGE BASE** is a set of sentences in some kind of **knowledge representation language**. **Axioms** are sentences that are given. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TELL**: adds sentences to the KB \n",
    "2. **ASK**: a question of the knowledge base KB\n",
    "3. **inference**: derives new sentences from old sentences - can be used in either **TELL** or **ASK**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **declarative** approach to system building only **TELLS** what the system needs to know and the system figures out **how** to accomplish a particular task. In constrast a **procedural** approach encodes the desired behaviors directly as program code. In the 1970s and 1980s, advocates of these two approaches engaged in heated debates. Most successful agents often combine both declarative and procedural elements in their design. "

    "\n",
    " There have been a lot of studies in cognitive science/psychology that assume that our perception or cognitive processes are not dependent on culture. In recent years it has been found that this is not the case. A lot of therse studies use the most readily available subjects i.e undergraduate students at Universities. A common acronym used for such subjects is **WEIRD**. The assumptions was that for things like what food or music someone likes culture is extremely important but perception and cognition are more universal.  **WEIRD** stands for Western, educated, and from industrialized, rich, and democratic countries. \n",
