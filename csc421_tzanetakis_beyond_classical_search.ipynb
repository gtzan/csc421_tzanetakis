    "# Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "This a chapter not typically covered in CSC421 so only a summary of what is covered is provided. The techniques described in this chapter are frequently useful when there is not a single desired optimal solution but many solutions that are all **good enough**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Local search methods such as **hill climbing** operate on complete-state formulations, keeping only a small number of nodes in memory. Several stochastic algorithms have been developed, including **simualted annealing** which returns optimal solutions when given an a appropriate cooling schedule.\n",
    "* Many local search methods also apply to problems in continuous spaces. **Linear programming** and **convex optimization** problems obey certain restrictions on the space of the state space and the nature of the objective function, and admit polynomial-time algorithms that are often extremely efficient in practice.\n",
    "* A **genetic algorithm** is a stochastic hill-climbing search in which a large population of states is maintained. New states are generated by **mutation** and by **cross-over**, which combines pairs of states from the population.\n",
    "* In **non-deterministic** environments agents can apply *AND-OR* search to generate **contigent** plans that reach the goal regardless of which outcomes occur during execution.\n",
    "* Standard search algorithms can be applied directly to belief-state space to solve **sensor-less problems**, and belief-state *AND-OR* search can solve general partially observable problems. Incremental algorithms that construct solutions state-by-state within a belief state are often more efficient.\n",
    "* **Exploration problems** arise when the agent has no idea about the states and actions of its environment. For safely explorable environments, **online search** agents can build a map and find a goal if one exists. Updating heuristic estimates from experience provides an effective method to escape from local minima.\n",
