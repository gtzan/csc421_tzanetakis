    "\n",
    "The most common type of learning is **parameter learning** where we assume a particular structure for our model and characterize it by estimating a set of parameters. For example we might assume a normal or Gaussian multi-variate distribution and estimate the mean vector and the covariance matrix that characterize it. As another example, we might be given the structure of a Bayesian network (in terms of parent/child coonditional relationships) and learn the conditional probabilty tables. We will also briefly discuss the problem of learning structure as well as non-parametric density estimation in which we don't need to make any assumptions about the model. \n",

If we have a dice with six faces that can only have the number 1, 2, and 3 then there is a finite amount of models and we can calculate their likelihoods as we did above. However if we relax the requirement to have a dice and simply have the values 1,2 and 3 but with arbitrary associated probabilities then we have an infinte number of possible models. Without going into the math it turns out that at least for this particular case the model that will have the maximum likelihood can be simply obtained by counting the relative frequencies of the values in the data.

    "There are many scenarios in learning probabilistic models in which there are hidden variables. This means that we have data for the evidence variables and we are interested in doing inference for some query variables but we do **NOT** have data for the hidden variables. \n",

    "1. Unsupervised clustering with mixtures of Gaussians\n",
    "2. Learning Bayesian networks with hidden variables \n",
    "3. Learning HMMs from observations without associated states \n",
    "\n",
    "In all these cases, a common approach is to use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an iterative algorithm in which at each step we improve our estimation of the parameters of a probabilistic model. The basic idea is simple to describe. Our probabilistic model is characterized by several parameters that we will denote as $\\theta$. For example for a discrete Naive Bayes classifier this would be the probabilities of each feature given the class, for a continuous Naive Bayes classifier, this would be the mean and variance of each feature given the class, for a Bayesian network these would be the conditional probability tables, for a HMM these would be the transition model and sensor model probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the **expectation step (E-step)** we use the current iteration model characterized by $\\theta_i$ to compute the expected values of the hidden variables for each example. In other words we use our current probability model to infer reasonable choices for the hidden variables for each example. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the **maximization step (M-step)** we have now \"complete\" data in the sense that have the data values for the non hidden variables that we had from the beginning as well as expected data we obtained by using our current guess of the parameters of the model. In this step we can perform maximum-likelihood parameter estimation using complete data and obtained an updated model characterized by a new $\\theta_{i+}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two steps are repeated until convergence (i.e the parameters between iterations don't change - or more accurately change by a very small amount). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of it is that if we have a probabilistic model we can sample it to generate data as well as use it to fill in missing values in the data that we have. After filling in these missing values we can learn a new model and repeat the process. In several notebooks we have seen this approach where we use a model to generate some data and then use that data to estimate a model (typicaly the estimated model is close to the original model). The EM-algorithm essentially alternates between these two steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand this basic principle, all sorts of variations and improvements can be used. For example the E-step can be done with approximate rather than exact inference or the M-step can be done with non-parametric estimation. The notations for specific problems can become relatively intimidating at first glance but if you really understand the basic principle you should be able to understand them for specific cases. \n"

Twenty years ago building such a system required many lines of C++ code and formed a large part of my PhD thesis which was completed in 2002. The journal article describing this work called \"Musical Genre Classification of Audio Signal\" is considered a classic paper in MIR."
